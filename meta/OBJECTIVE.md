# V4 Build Pack — Objective

## What We Are Building
DocuIntelli: a Cognitive ERP platform for regulated enterprise (commercial real estate, debt, property intelligence). Price point: $200k/yr per seat.

## Why V4 Exists
Three prior build packs (V1, V2, V2-merged) each had unique value but none was complete:
- **V1**: Broadest product coverage (17 epics), best standards framework (15 areas), best concept decomposition
- **V2**: Domain modules (5 revenue products), enterprise shell, new primitives (DocIR, Skills, Context Inheritance)
- **V2M**: Highest quality implementation patterns (3 pattern files), corrected dependencies, 45 GAP items identified

V4 merges best-of-all-worlds and applies 7 quality reviews to produce an actionable build plan.

## Success Criteria
1. Every milestone boundary delivers usable customer value (no "7 milestones of platform before first revenue")
2. Lease CD wedge product demo-able in ~8 weeks
3. All internal contradictions resolved before code is written
4. Shared primitives identified and designed (saving 26-38% of issues)
5. Intelligence stack (evidence → insights → models → dashboards → stale propagation) preserved as the competitive moat
6. Standards framework (V1's 15 areas) carried forward and enforced
7. All 34 MCP/agentic gaps addressed in the epic structure
8. 4 new epics added: Notifications, Export/Excel, Collaboration, Onboarding

## Key Metrics
- **Current V3 baseline**: 30 epics, ~424 issues, ~2,970 tasks across 5 tracks
- **V4 target**: ~32-34 epics, ~300-350 issues (after shared primitives savings), commercially sequenced
- **Review scores to beat**: Coherence 6.2→8+, Commercial 4.5→8+, Completeness 5.5→7+, MCP 4.3→6+
