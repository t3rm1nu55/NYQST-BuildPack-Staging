# Insight 004: 7 Review Lenses for Build Pack Quality

## Context
Applied 7 review lenses to V3 synthesis. Scores ranged from 4.3/10 to 7.3/10.

## Learning
These 7 lenses provide comprehensive coverage:
1. Coherence & Integration Sequencing (epic structure, dependency ordering)
2. Priority & Commercial Ordering (revenue path, effort allocation)
3. Feature Completeness (missing features, screens, integrations)
4. MCP & Agentic Architecture (tools, agents, context, LLM, security)
5. Standards & Quality Framework (testing, CI/CD, hooks, contracts)
6. Cross-Reference Integrity (contradictions, consistency, dropped findings)
7. Meta-Review (efficiencies, risks, what other reviews to do, strengths)

The meta-review (7) is the most valuable — it identifies shared primitives, build-vs-buy, and what further analysis is needed.

## Additional Reviews Recommended
- Data Model Review (HIGH value, MEDIUM cost)
- Cost Model Analysis (HIGH value, LOW cost)
- Migration Path Review (HIGH value, LOW cost)

## Reuse
Any build pack or implementation plan. Run all 7 lenses before locking the plan.
