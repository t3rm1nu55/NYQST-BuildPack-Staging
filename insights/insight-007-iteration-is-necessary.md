# Insight 007: Design Iteration Is Necessary, Not a Failure

## Context
The V3 synthesis went through: 6 agent extraction → synthesis → 6 quality reviews → meta-review → contradictions identified → 4 consolidation runs planned.

## Learning
This iterative process is not waste — it is how complex plans get right:
1. First pass (agents): extract and organize raw material
2. Second pass (synthesis): merge and resolve conflicts
3. Third pass (reviews): stress-test from multiple angles
4. Fourth pass (consolidation): apply fixes and produce final spec

Each pass catches things the previous pass missed. The V3 synthesis (pass 2) missed DocIR, dropped 3 P0 gaps, had 15 contradictions. These would have become implementation bugs without the review passes.

The cost of finding a contradiction in planning is 2 hours of decisions. The cost of finding it during implementation is 2 weeks of rework.

## Reuse
Budget 3-4 passes for any complex plan. Don't expect the first synthesis to be final.
