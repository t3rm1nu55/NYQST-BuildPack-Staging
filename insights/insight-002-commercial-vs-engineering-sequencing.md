# Insight 002: Commercial vs Engineering Sequencing

## Context
V3 synthesis scored 4.5/10 on commercial ordering despite being architecturally sound.

## Learning
Engineering plans sequence bottom-up (foundations → surfaces → products). Commercial plans sequence wedge-first (minimum viable product → generalize → breadth). For revenue-generating platforms, commercial sequencing must override engineering sequencing. The question is not "what does the platform need?" but "what does the first customer need to sign?"

## Evidence
- Lease CDs (the $200k/yr wedge) was at M8 — behind 7 milestones of platform
- 51% of effort on Tracks A+B (zero direct revenue), 33% on Track C (ALL revenue)
- GenUI spec had 27 primitives; Lease CD needs 3-5

## Reuse
Any platform-first product. Always ask: "At each milestone boundary, can a customer USE the product?"
