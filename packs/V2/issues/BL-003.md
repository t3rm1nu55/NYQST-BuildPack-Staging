# BL-003 — Add web research toolset (Brave/Tavily + Jina Reader) with provenance

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M1-W0`
- Repo alignment: **partial**
- Labels: `backend`, `tools`, `wave:0`
- Depends on: `EPIC-W0`, `BL-001`

## Problem

Research harness needs reliable web search and page fetch/reader tools with provenance and rate limiting. Repo currently has placeholder web search and no dedicated page reader.

## Proposed solution

Implement web research tools as LangChain tools (and MCP-compatible wrappers later):
- `search_web(query)` using Brave Search (or Tavily as interchangeable provider).
- `fetch_page(url)` using Jina Reader (or equivalent) to return clean markdown.
- `extract_facts(text)` lightweight extractor (optional).

All outputs must be stored as immutable artifacts with content hashes, and referenced in TaskResults / citations.

## Repo touchpoints

- `src/intelli/agents/tools/research_tools.py`
- `src/intelli/services/knowledge/*`
- `src/intelli/services/substrate/*`

## Spec / reference pointers

- reference/archive/plans/BACKLOG.md (BL-003)

## Acceptance criteria

- Planner/worker can call search + fetch and receive consistent results.
- Tool outputs are stored as artifacts (with sha256) and linked to run events (`references_found`).
- Basic rate limiting and retries exist.

## Test plan

- Unit: tool adapter handles provider errors with retry/backoff.
- Integration: store artifacts and verify retrieval by hash.

## Notes

Repo already has `search_web` stub; extend + add reader + provenance.
