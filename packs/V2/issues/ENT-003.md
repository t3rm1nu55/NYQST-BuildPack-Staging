# ENT-003 — Audit log: expand coverage (runs, docs, tool calls) + admin UI viewer

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M6-ENTERPRISE`
- Repo alignment: **partial**
- Labels: `backend`, `frontend`, `audit`
- Depends on: `ENT-002`

## Problem

Audit log model exists but coverage is incomplete; admins need visibility for compliance and debugging.

## Proposed solution

- Ensure audit events are written for: login/logout, document upload/download, run start/stop, tool calls, deliverable exports, permission changes.
- Add `/api/v1/audit` endpoints (admin-only) for querying.
- Add UI page/table for audit log review with filtering.

## Repo touchpoints

- `src/intelli/db/models/auth.py`
- `src/intelli/api/v1/*`
- `ui/src/pages/* (new audit page)`

## Acceptance criteria

- Audit records exist for core actions and include actor, target, timestamp, metadata.
- Admin can query and export audit logs.

## Test plan

- Integration: actions create audit entries; RBAC prevents non-admin access.
