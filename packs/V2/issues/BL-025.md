# BL-025 — DocuIntelli: dimension discovery agent (derive new dimensions from corpus)

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M7-DOCUINTELLI`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `domain:docuintelli`, `backend`, `frontend`
- Depends on: `EPIC-DOCUINTELLI`, `DI-002`

## Problem

DocuIntelli should not rely solely on predefined dimensions; it must discover emergent dimensions and propose them with evidence.

## Proposed solution

Implement dimension discovery:
- Agent scans corpus summaries/DocIR blocks to propose candidate dimensions.
- Each dimension includes: name, description, evidence examples, suggested scoring method.
- Human-in-the-loop approval in UI before adding to model.

## Acceptance criteria

- On a fixture corpus, system proposes a list of candidate dimensions with evidence references.
- UI supports approving/rejecting dimensions and saving them to a dimension library.

## Test plan

- Integration: discovery run produces candidate dimensions; approvals persist.
