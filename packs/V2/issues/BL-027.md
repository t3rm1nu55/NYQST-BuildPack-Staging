# BL-027 — DocuIntelli: process template engine (turn analysis into repeatable workflows)

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M7-DOCUINTELLI`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `domain:docuintelli`, `workflow`
- Depends on: `STUDIO-007`, `BL-026`

## Problem

Once patterns and dimensions exist, users need repeatable processes (templates) to run analyses consistently across corpora.

## Proposed solution

Implement process templates:
- A template defines: selected frameworks, dimensions, patterns, thresholds, deliverables.
- Templates can be run as workflows (compile to LangGraph) and emit standard outputs.
- UI: template builder with presets; run history and comparisons.

## Acceptance criteria

- User can create a template and run it on a corpus; outputs are consistent and versioned.

## Test plan

- Integration: template run generates expected artifacts.
