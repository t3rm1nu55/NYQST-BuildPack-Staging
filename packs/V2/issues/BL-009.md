# BL-009 — Emit Plan events from graph (plan_created/task_updated) and map to UI

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M2-W1`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `runs`, `wave:1`
- Depends on: `BL-001`, `BL-002`, `BL-007`

## Problem

Even with PlanSet storage, UI needs live events to show task-level progress and to coordinate overlays.

## Proposed solution

In the orchestrated graph:
- Emit `plan_created` run_event after planner returns PlanSet.
- Emit `plan_task_status_changed` when each worker starts/completes/fails.
- Optionally emit `plan_updated` when planner refines tasks (Wave 2).

Update adapter/run_event logger to accept explicit plan events.

## Acceptance criteria

- Run timeline shows plan created + per-task status change events.
- PlanViewer updates from these events without polling.

## Test plan

- Integration: run emits expected plan events in order.
