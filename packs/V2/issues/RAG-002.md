# RAG-002 — Knowledge base UI: chunk preview, retrieval test console, and tuning controls

- Type: **story**

- Depends on: `RAG-001`, `ENT-002`

## Problem

Users/admins need visibility and control over indexing and retrieval (chunk sizes, overlap, filters).

## Proposed solution

Extend Docs/Notebooks UI:
- Show chunk previews and metadata.
- Add a retrieval test console with query → results scoring.
- Expose tuning controls (chunk size/overlap, hybrid weights) guarded by admin role.

## Acceptance criteria

- Admin can run retrieval test and view chunk previews; tuning changes take effect after reindex.

## Test plan

- E2E: retrieval test console returns expected results.
