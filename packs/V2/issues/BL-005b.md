# BL-005b — Implement incremental GML parser (client-side)

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M2-W1`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `frontend`
- Depends on: `BL-005a`

## Problem

Streaming preview needs incremental parsing; naive full-string parsing breaks on partial tags.

## Proposed solution

Implement a tolerant parser strategy:
- Maintain a buffer of received text
- Attempt parse on each delta; if parse fails due to incomplete tail, keep last valid AST and wait
- When parse fails due to structural error, trigger healer

## Acceptance criteria

- Parser can handle deltas arriving mid-tag and mid-attribute.
- AST remains stable between deltas until a new valid parse succeeds.

## Test plan

- Unit tests using streaming fixtures.
