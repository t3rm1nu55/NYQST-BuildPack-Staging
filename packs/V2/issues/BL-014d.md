# BL-014d — UI: Context manager (create packs, attach to project/app, view indexing status)

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M3-W2`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `frontend`, `context`
- Depends on: `BL-014a`

## Problem

Users need to manage context packs and understand what is indexed.

## Proposed solution

Add Settings/Context UI: pack list/detail, attach/detach, show sources, indexing status, and retrieval test box.

## Acceptance criteria

- User can create a pack, attach to project, and run a retrieval test from UI.

## Test plan

- E2E: create pack → attach → run test → see results.
