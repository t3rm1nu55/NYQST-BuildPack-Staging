# BL-019b — Implement DOCX template + generator library (report → docx)

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M3-W2`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `docx`
- Depends on: `BL-019`

## Problem

Document generation must be templated and consistent with branding/legal appendices.

## Proposed solution

Create templates and generator code to transform report sections and citations into docx; support tables and charts as images.

## Acceptance criteria

- Generator produces docx with headings, tables, and citations for fixture report.

## Test plan

- Integration: generate docx and validate with python-docx (structure checks).
