# BL-001c — Implement worker execution using Send() fan-out and structured TaskResult returns

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M1-W0`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `langgraph`
- Depends on: `BL-001b`

## Problem

Parallelizing tasks requires reliable fan-out and a standard way for workers to return structured results (not just text).

## Proposed solution

Implement worker dispatch:
- `dispatch()` converts PlanSet tasks to `Send("worker", {task})`.
- Each worker runs the existing tool-using agent with task context and returns `TaskResult`.
- Capture tool outputs as artifacts (temporary) and attach refs in TaskResult (align with BL-011 later).

## Acceptance criteria

- Workers execute tasks concurrently and return TaskResult objects.
- Failure in one task is captured and surfaced (does not crash run).

## Test plan

- Integration: run with 3 tasks; assert 3 TaskResults returned.
