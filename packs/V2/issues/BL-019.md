# BL-019 — Document deliverable pipeline (DOCX/PDF) from report + citations

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M3-W2`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `deliverables`, `doc`, `wave:2`
- Depends on: `BL-015`, `BL-016`, `BL-005`

## Problem

Users in financial services need a downloadable Word/PDF version of deliverables. Repo lacks document generation.

## Proposed solution

Implement document generation:
- Input: report content + citations + figures.
- Output: `.docx` and/or `.pdf` artifacts with consistent styling (NYQST templates).
- Include appendix: sources table, methodology, disclaimers.
- Store artifacts + manifest; link from deliverable store.

## Spec / reference pointers

- reference/archive/plans/BACKLOG.md (BL-019)

## Acceptance criteria

- Document deliverable can be generated and downloaded from UI.
- Document includes citations and a sources appendix.

## Test plan

- Integration: generate a doc from fixture report; verify file exists and non-empty.
