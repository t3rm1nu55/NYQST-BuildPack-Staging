# BL-026 — DocuIntelli: pattern library + matcher (detect patterns/anomalies across corpus)

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M7-DOCUINTELLI`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `domain:docuintelli`, `backend`, `frontend`
- Depends on: `BL-025`

## Problem

Detecting contract/regulatory patterns requires a reusable pattern library and a matcher that returns matches with citations and confidence.

## Proposed solution

Build pattern library:
- Store patterns as structured definitions (clauses, regex/semantic, examples).
- Matcher runs across DocIR blocks and returns matches with locators + scores.
- Store results as artifacts and render in UI (filterable list + heatmaps later).

## Acceptance criteria

- Patterns can be created/edited and matched against a corpus.
- Matches include citations/locators that can be opened in viewer.

## Test plan

- Integration: matcher finds expected patterns in fixtures.
