# BL-015b — UI: add DeliverableSelector control and send deliverable_type via AI SDK transport

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M3-W2`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `frontend`
- Depends on: `BL-015a`

## Problem

Frontend currently sends only module/pointer/manifest ids. It must send deliverable_type with each user message.

## Proposed solution

- Add DeliverableSelector (dropdown) in ChatPanel input row.
- Store current selection in local state.
- Extend `NyqstAITransport` request body to include deliverable_type on send.

## Repo touchpoints

- `ui/src/components/chat/*`
- `ui/src/providers/assistant-runtime.tsx`

## Acceptance criteria

- Deliverable type selection is visible, persists per conversation (or per tab), and is included in outbound requests.

## Test plan

- UI unit test: selection changes request payload.
