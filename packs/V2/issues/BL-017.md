# BL-017 — Meta-reasoning node: validate citations, detect low-confidence claims, suggest repairs

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M3-W2`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `quality`, `wave:2`
- Depends on: `BL-016`, `BL-001d`

## Problem

To avoid confidently wrong output, spec includes a meta-reasoning (self-critic) pass to validate citations coverage, coherence, and risk before finalizing deliverables.

## Proposed solution

Add a `meta_reasoning` node after synthesis / report draft:
- Check that factual claims have citations.
- Flag contradictions, missing evidence, and outdated sources.
- Produce a structured `MetaReview` artifact and optionally trigger plan revisions or clarification questions.

## Spec / reference pointers

- reference/archive/plans/BACKLOG.md (BL-017)

## Acceptance criteria

- Runs produce a MetaReview artifact with clear pass/fail and recommended fixes.
- When MetaReview fails, system either revises plan or triggers clarification flow (BL-021).

## Test plan

- Eval: prompts with deliberate unsupported claims are flagged.
