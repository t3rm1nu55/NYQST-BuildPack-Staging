# BL-018 — Slides deliverable pipeline (Reveal-based) with citations and charts

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M3-W2`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `deliverables`, `slides`, `wave:2`
- Depends on: `BL-015`, `BL-022`

## Problem

Spec requires a slide deck output that can be generated from DataBrief/report content and stored as artifacts. Repo has no slide generation pipeline.

## Proposed solution

Implement slide generation:
- Prompt: generate `slides.json` (title, sections, bullets, speaker notes, citations).
- Renderer: convert slides.json → Reveal.js HTML deck (and optionally PDF).
- Store as artifact bundle: `slides.html`, assets, and a manifest.
- UI: add download/open link in deliverable panel.

## Spec / reference pointers

- reference/archive/plans/BACKLOG.md (BL-018)

## Acceptance criteria

- A run can produce a slide deck artifact that opens locally (static HTML) and is linked to the run.
- Slides include citations (footnote markers) where required.

## Test plan

- Integration: generate slides.json fixture → render deck → validate HTML contains expected sections.
