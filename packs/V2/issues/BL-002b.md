# BL-002b — Improve SSE stream reliability: resume by last sequence + backoff

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M1-W0`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `frontend`, `sse`
- Depends on: `BL-002`, `P0-002`

## Problem

Current SSE hook reconnects with a fixed delay and replays from scratch; high-volume runs risk missing events or showing duplicates.

## Proposed solution

- Backend: add optional `since_sequence` query param to `/streams/runs/{run_id}` to replay from last seen sequence (or use `Last-Event-ID`).
- Frontend: store last received sequence; reconnect with exponential backoff; request replay from `since_sequence`.

## Acceptance criteria

- Disconnect/reconnect does not lose events; events are deduped by (run_id, sequence).
- Backoff increases up to a max and stops after a cap (configurable).

## Test plan

- Integration: simulate network drop; reconnect continues stream correctly.
