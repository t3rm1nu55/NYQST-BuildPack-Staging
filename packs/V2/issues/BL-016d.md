# BL-016d — Emit references_found and citations_bound events from tools and binder

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M3-W2`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `runs`
- Depends on: `BL-016b`, `BL-002`

## Problem

Overlay and timeline require explicit events for evidence discovery and citation binding.

## Proposed solution

Update tool wrappers and binder to emit RunEvents: `references_found` when new entities stored; `citations_bound` when citation records created.

## Acceptance criteria

- Run stream shows references_found and citations_bound with IDs; UI updates accordingly.

## Test plan

- Integration: run emits events in correct order.
