# OBS-002 — Metrics + health endpoints (queue depth, latency, error rates, cost)

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M6-OBS`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `observability`
- Depends on: `EPIC-OBS`

## Problem

Production readiness requires metrics dashboards and health checks for services and queues.

## Proposed solution

- Add `/healthz` and `/readyz` endpoints.
- Export Prometheus metrics: request latency, errors, token usage, queue depth, OpenSearch latency.
- Document dashboards and alert thresholds.

## Acceptance criteria

- Metrics endpoint exists and emits core metrics.
- Health endpoints reflect dependencies status (db, redis, opensearch).

## Test plan

- Integration: healthz returns unhealthy when db down (mock).
