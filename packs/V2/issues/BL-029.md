# BL-029 — DocuIntelli: dimensional visualization engine (heatmaps, matrices, timelines) with GenUI

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M7-DOCUINTELLI`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `domain:docuintelli`, `frontend`, `genui`
- Depends on: `BL-004`, `BL-028`

## Problem

Corpus analysis results need clear visualizations (dimension heatmaps, coverage matrices) with citations and drilldown.

## Proposed solution

Implement visualization:
- Define visualization descriptors (heatmap, matrix, timeline) using GenUI contracts.
- Render in UI with interactivity (hover to show evidence, click to open doc span).
- Ensure visualizations can be exported to slides and reports.

## Acceptance criteria

- At least 2 visualization types render from DocuIntelli outputs with drilldown.

## Test plan

- UI: render visualization fixtures; interactions work.
