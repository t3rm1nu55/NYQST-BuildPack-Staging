# BL-023 — DocuIntelli: cross-framework reconciliation tool (compare/resolve multiple frameworks)

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M7-DOCUINTELLI`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `domain:docuintelli`, `backend`, `frontend`
- Depends on: `EPIC-DOCUINTELLI`, `DI-002`

## Problem

DocuIntelli requires reconciling outputs across multiple frameworks (IFRS vs internal model, regulatory vs operational) to identify conflicts and coverage gaps.

## Proposed solution

Implement reconciliation:
- Input: two or more framework outputs (dimensions + findings + citations).
- Output: reconciliation matrix highlighting overlaps, conflicts, and missing coverage.
- Store as artifacts and render in UI (table + filters + citations).

## Spec / reference pointers

- reference/NYQST_Platform_Production_Intelligence_Build_Guide_v5.md (DocuIntelli new BL items)

## Acceptance criteria

- System can generate a reconciliation artifact for at least two frameworks on a fixture corpus.
- UI can display matrix and drill into evidence for a selected cell.

## Test plan

- Integration: reconciliation on fixture outputs produces deterministic matrix.
