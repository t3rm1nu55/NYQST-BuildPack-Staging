# BL-001d — Implement fan-in synth node to build DataBrief from TaskResults

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M1-W0`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `langgraph`
- Depends on: `BL-001c`

## Problem

Deliverables need a consistent shared data brief (facts, citations, open questions). Without synthesis, results stay fragmented.

## Proposed solution

Implement `synthesize()` node:
- Input: list of TaskResults.
- Output: DataBrief.
- Use a synthesis prompt that requires citations to reference evidence refs.
- De-duplicate facts and normalize confidence/risk fields.

## Acceptance criteria

- DataBrief produced for successful runs and is attached to run state.
- Synthesis preserves links to evidence refs for later citation binding.

## Test plan

- Unit: deterministic merge for duplicate facts; stable ordering.
