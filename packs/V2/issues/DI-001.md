# DI-001 — DocuIntelli foundation: document bundles, versions, and corpus metadata model

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M7-DOCUINTELLI`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `domain:docuintelli`, `backend`, `frontend`
- Depends on: `EPIC-DOCUINTELLI`, `STUDIO-001`

## Problem

DocuIntelli workflows require grouping documents into corpora/bundles with versioning and metadata (source, date, counterparty). Current substrate stores artifacts but lacks higher-level corpus organization.

## Proposed solution

Add DocuIntelli corpus primitives:
- DB: `corpora` (tenant_id, name, description, tags), `corpus_documents` linking to artifacts/manifests with metadata + version fields.
- Provide APIs to create corpora, add/remove documents, and manage versions.
- UI: corpus explorer (list/detail) with version timeline and filters.

## Acceptance criteria

- A corpus can be created and populated with document versions.
- Corpus documents carry metadata usable for filtering and analysis (source, date, type).

## Test plan

- Integration: corpus CRUD; version linking; permissions.
