# P0-004 — Make Redis always-on in dev compose (remove profile gating)

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M0-P0`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `priority:P0`, `infra`, `devx`
- Depends on: `EPIC-P0`

## Problem

Redis is required for queueing/background jobs in the platform, but docker-compose currently puts redis behind an optional profile, causing inconsistent dev environments and failures.

## Proposed solution

Update `docker-compose.yml`:
- Remove `profiles: ["full"]` from `redis` and `arq_worker` services (or provide a default profile).
- Ensure `docker compose up` starts redis + worker by default.
- Update README and any scripts accordingly.

## Repo touchpoints

- `docker-compose.yml`
- `README.md`

## Spec / reference pointers

- reference/NYQST_Platform_Production_Intelligence_Build_Guide_v5.md (P0-4)

## Acceptance criteria

- `docker compose up` starts Postgres, OpenSearch, MinIO, Redis, backend, UI, and the arq worker (if intended).
- No other services are unexpectedly pulled in; profiles remain only for truly optional heavy dependencies.

## Test plan

- Smoke: clean clone → `docker compose up` succeeds without extra flags.
