# BL-014a — DB model for ContextPacks + attachments to projects/apps/conversations

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M3-W2`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `db`, `context`
- Depends on: `BL-014`

## Problem

Context inheritance needs persistent ContextPack objects and attachments to scopes.

## Proposed solution

Create `context_packs` and `context_pack_attachments` tables with scope fields and ordering/precedence rules.

## Acceptance criteria

- ContextPack tables exist and are tenant-scoped; attachments enforce uniqueness per scope.

## Test plan

- Migration test; repository CRUD unit tests.
