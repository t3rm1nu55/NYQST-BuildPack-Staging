# OBS-003 — Evals and regression suite wired into CI (golden prompts, output scoring)

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M6-OBS`
- Repo alignment: **partial**
- Labels: `quality`, `evals`, `ci`
- Depends on: `P0-005`, `EPIC-OBS`

## Problem

Repo has evals folder but evals are not enforced. Agentic systems regress subtly; evals must run in CI.

## Proposed solution

- Define a small golden prompt set per module (research, notebook Q&A, deliverables).
- Implement scoring: plan quality, citation coverage, output format validity, latency bounds.
- Wire into CI with a fast subset on PR and a larger nightly suite.

## Acceptance criteria

- PR CI runs eval smoke suite and blocks merges on failures.
- Nightly suite runs and stores results (artifact or dashboard).

## Test plan

- Meta: eval harness has tests; sample fixture yields expected score.
