# BL-028 — DocuIntelli: anomaly detection engine (rank gaps, contradictions, outliers)

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M7-DOCUINTELLI`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `domain:docuintelli`, `backend`, `frontend`
- Depends on: `BL-023`, `BL-026`

## Problem

Core value is identifying anomalies and gaps with evidence and severity ranking.

## Proposed solution

Implement anomaly detection:
- Inputs: dimension scores + pattern matches + reconciliation matrices.
- Outputs: anomaly list (type, severity, description, impacted docs, evidence locators).
- UI: anomaly dashboard with filters and drilldown to evidence.

## Acceptance criteria

- Anomaly dashboard shows ranked anomalies with evidence and severity.
- Anomalies can be exported into Decisions or tasks.

## Test plan

- Integration: anomalies generated from fixture corpus and stable ranking.
