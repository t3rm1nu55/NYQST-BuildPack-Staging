# OBS-004 — Load testing and streaming reliability tests (N concurrent runs)

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M6-OBS`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `quality`, `loadtest`
- Depends on: `BL-002b`, `EPIC-OBS`

## Problem

Streaming and run event systems often fail under concurrency; need a repeatable load test harness.

## Proposed solution

- Add a load test tool (locust/k6) to simulate concurrent runs and SSE clients.
- Measure: event loss, ordering, latency, memory usage.
- Gate releases on a minimum stability threshold.

## Acceptance criteria

- Load test can run locally and in CI nightly, producing a report artifact.

## Test plan

- N/A (this is the test harness).
