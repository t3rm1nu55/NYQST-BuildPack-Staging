# BL-018c — Wire slide generation into arq job and deliverable store

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M3-W2`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `arq`, `deliverables`
- Depends on: `BL-015`, `BL-018b`

## Problem

Renderer must run asynchronously and results must be discoverable by identifier.

## Proposed solution

Create arq job `generate_slides(run_id, reportIdentifier)`; store outputs in deliverable store and emit `deliverable_ready` event.

## Acceptance criteria

- Job runs end-to-end and deliverable is linked to run.

## Test plan

- Integration: enqueue job and assert deliverable_ready event + artifacts.
