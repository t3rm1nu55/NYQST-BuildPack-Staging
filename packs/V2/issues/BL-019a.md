# BL-019a — Website deliverable pipeline (standalone Next.js or static site) generated from report

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M3-W2`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `deliverables`, `website`
- Depends on: `BL-015`, `BL-022`

## Problem

Spec includes a Website deliverable (v0-style) deployed as standalone output; repo currently has no pipeline for it.

## Proposed solution

Build a 'website generator' arq job:
- Input: report + DataBrief + assets
- Output: a folder artifact containing either:
  - a Next.js app scaffold (if you want interactivity), or
  - a static site (HTML/CSS/JS) for simpler hosting.
- Include `README` with run identifier and deploy instructions.

## Spec / reference pointers

- reference/NYQST_Platform_Production_Intelligence_Build_Guide_v5.md (Deliverables: Website)

## Acceptance criteria

- Website deliverable artifacts are generated and downloadable as a zip or browsable directory.
- Generated site includes citations and at least one interactive element (e.g., expandable sections).

## Test plan

- Integration: generator produces deterministic output for fixture input.
