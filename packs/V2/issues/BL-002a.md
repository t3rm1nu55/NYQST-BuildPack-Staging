# BL-002a — Add new RunEventType enum values + payload schemas (backend)

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M1-W0`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `contracts`
- Depends on: `BL-002`

## Problem

Event type expansion needs DB + model updates plus validation so payloads are stable across clients.

## Proposed solution

- Extend `RunEventType` enum in `src/intelli/db/models/runs.py`.
- Add Pydantic payload models for each new event type (in `src/intelli/contracts/run_events.py`).
- Validate payloads before insert; store `schema_version` in payload.

## Acceptance criteria

- New enum values exist and are used by adapter/graphs.
- Invalid payloads are rejected server-side with clear errors.

## Test plan

- Unit: validate payloads for each event type.
