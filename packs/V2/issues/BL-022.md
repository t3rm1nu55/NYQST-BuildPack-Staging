# BL-022 — Shared data brief: persist DataBrief and reuse across deliverables

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M4-W3`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `deliverables`, `wave:3`
- Depends on: `BL-001d`, `BL-016`

## Problem

DataBrief is the canonical set of facts/assumptions/citations that should power all deliverables (report/slides/document/website). Without persistence/reuse, outputs drift.

## Proposed solution

Persist DataBrief:
- Store as an artifact (`data_brief.json`) linked to run + deliverable identifier.
- Provide API to fetch DataBrief by run_id or reportIdentifier.
- Update deliverable pipelines to consume DataBrief, not re-query sources independently.

## Spec / reference pointers

- reference/archive/plans/BACKLOG.md (BL-022)

## Acceptance criteria

- A completed run has a stored DataBrief artifact and API to retrieve it.
- Slides/document/website pipelines reuse the same DataBrief and citations set.

## Test plan

- Integration: ensure deliverable pipelines read DataBrief and produce consistent citations list.
