# BL-018b — Implement Reveal deck renderer (slides.json → HTML) + asset bundling

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M3-W2`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `slides`
- Depends on: `BL-018a`

## Problem

Need deterministic renderer and packaging so decks can be served/downloaded reliably.

## Proposed solution

Implement renderer that produces Reveal HTML, copies assets, and writes a manifest; store as artifact bundle.

## Acceptance criteria

- Renderer produces a working deck for fixtures; bundle is downloadable.

## Test plan

- Integration: render fixture and validate output files.
