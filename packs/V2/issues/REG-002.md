## Problem

Need to extract obligations and map them to internal controls/policies for reconciliation.

## Proposed solution

- Define controls framework model (controls, policies, owners).
- Extract obligations from DocIR and map to controls via embeddings + LLM.
- Produce mapping artifacts with evidence.

## Acceptance criteria

- Obligations extracted and mapped with citations; gaps identified.

## Test plan

- Eval: mapping accuracy on fixture controls set.
