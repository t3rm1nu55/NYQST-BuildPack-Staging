# OBS-001 — Tracing integration (LangSmith + optional Langfuse/OTel) across graphs and tools

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M6-OBS`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `observability`, `tracing`
- Depends on: `EPIC-OBS`, `BL-001`

## Problem

Without tracing, debugging agentic workflows and regressions is slow. Repo currently does not integrate LangSmith/Langfuse tracing.

## Proposed solution

Add tracing provider abstraction:
- Configure LangChain tracing env vars for LangSmith (and optionally Langfuse).
- Add trace IDs to run metadata and propagate to run events.
- Instrument tool wrappers and key graph nodes with spans.

## Acceptance criteria

- When tracing enabled, a run produces a trace with nodes/tools and timings.
- Trace ID is visible in NYQST UI (run details) and stored with run record.

## Test plan

- Smoke: run with tracing enabled emits spans (can be mocked).
