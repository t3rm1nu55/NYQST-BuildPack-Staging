- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M3-W2`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `contracts`, `slides`
- Depends on: `BL-018`

## Problem

Slides pipeline needs a stable intermediate representation for renderer and tests.

## Acceptance criteria

## Test plan

- Unit: schema validation + fixture tests.
