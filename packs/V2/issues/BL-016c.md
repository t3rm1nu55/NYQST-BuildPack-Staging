# BL-016c — UI components for citations (CitationPopover, CitationList, EvidenceViewer integration)

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M3-W2`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `frontend`, `citations`
- Depends on: `BL-016b`

## Problem

Users must be able to inspect evidence quickly without losing context.

## Proposed solution

Implement Citation UI primitives and integrate into ReportPanel and Decisions; clicking opens artifact viewer at correct locator/snippet.

## Acceptance criteria

- Clicking an inline citation opens a popover with source metadata and a link to evidence viewer.

## Test plan

- UI test: citation click opens popover and navigates to evidence.
