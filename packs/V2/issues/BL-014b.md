# BL-014b — Indexing jobs for context packs (background embeddings + OpenSearch index updates)

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M3-W2`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `indexing`, `arq`
- Depends on: `BL-014a`, `P0-001`

## Problem

Context packs must be kept fresh automatically as documents and notes change.

## Proposed solution

Add arq jobs that watch for changes and re-embed/re-index affected sources; record status and last indexed timestamps.

## Acceptance criteria

- Updating a document triggers re-index of affected context packs within acceptable lag.

## Test plan

- Integration: simulate document update and assert indexing job runs and updates index.
