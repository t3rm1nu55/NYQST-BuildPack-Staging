# BL-010 — Citation binding UI: allow user to bind report claims to evidence

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M2-W1`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `frontend`, `citations`, `wave:1`
- Depends on: `BL-005`, `BL-003`

## Problem

Spec requires provenance and that users can review/bind citations. Repo shows sources but doesn't allow binding claims to evidence spans.

## Proposed solution

Implement citation binding UX:
- In ReportPanel, allow selecting a sentence/paragraph and clicking “Add citation”.
- Show SourcesPanel with candidate evidence (from retrieval + tool artifacts).
- On select, create a `citation_binding` record (local state first; persisted later in BL-016).
- Render inline citation markers `[1]` linking to evidence viewer.

## Repo touchpoints

- `ui/src/components/report/*`
- `ui/src/components/sources/*`

## Acceptance criteria

- User can bind at least one citation to a highlighted claim and see inline markers.
- Evidence viewer opens the referenced artifact (pdf/web page) or snippet.

## Test plan

- UI test: select text → open sources → bind → marker renders.
