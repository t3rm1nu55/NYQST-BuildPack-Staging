# BL-016b — Entity/Citation API endpoints (create, bulk fetch, search) with RBAC

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M3-W2`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `api`, `security`
- Depends on: `BL-016a`, `ENT-002`

## Problem

UI needs APIs to bind and fetch citations; also needed for exports.

## Proposed solution

Add routers `/api/v1/entities` and `/api/v1/citations` with bulk fetch endpoints and RBAC checks.

## Acceptance criteria

- APIs support: create entity, list/search entities, create citation, list citations for report/run/decision.

## Test plan

- Integration: RBAC enforced; bulk fetch works.
