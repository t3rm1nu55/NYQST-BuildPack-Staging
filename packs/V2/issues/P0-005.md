# P0-005 — Add GitHub Actions CI for backend + UI (lint, unit tests, minimal integration)

- Type: **task**
- Milestone: `M0-P0`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `priority:P0`, `ci`, `quality`
- Depends on: `EPIC-P0`

## Problem

No PR CI means regressions slip through and parallel agent work collides.

## Proposed solution

Add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
- Backend: install deps, run ruff/format checks, run pytest (unit + lightweight integration).
- UI: install deps, run lint, run typecheck, run unit tests (if present).
- Optionally spin Postgres/OpenSearch/MinIO containers for integration tests using service containers.

## Repo touchpoints

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `Makefile`
- `ui/package.json`
- `pyproject.toml`

## Spec / reference pointers

- reference/archive/gap-analysis/02_GAP_ANALYSIS.md (CI gap)

## Acceptance criteria

- CI runs on PRs and main pushes.
- CI fails on lint/type/test failures and reports clearly.
- A documented local equivalent exists (Make targets).

## Test plan

- CI itself is validated by a sample PR run (dry run not possible here; ensure workflow syntax is correct).
