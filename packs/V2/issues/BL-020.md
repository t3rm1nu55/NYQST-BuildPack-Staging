# BL-020 — Generation overlay UI: unified run progress, plan, citations, and artifacts

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M4-W3`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `frontend`, `ux`, `wave:3`
- Depends on: `BL-008`, `BL-002`, `BL-011`

## Problem

Users need a single, clear view of what the system is doing during long runs: which tasks are executing, what evidence was found, what artifacts are being produced.

## Proposed solution

Implement Generation Overlay:
- A right-side or bottom drawer overlay that shows:
  - PlanViewer (tasks + statuses)
  - Run timeline key events
  - Citations/references found
  - Artifacts created (download links)
- Overlay opens automatically on run start; collapsible and non-blocking.

## Spec / reference pointers

- reference/archive/plans/BACKLOG.md (BL-020)

## Acceptance criteria

- Overlay opens on run start and updates in real-time.
- Overlay remains responsive under high event volume.
- User can jump from overlay to artifact viewer or sources.

## Test plan

- E2E: start run → overlay shows plan progress and artifact links.
