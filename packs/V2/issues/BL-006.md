# BL-006 — Stream report preview deltas during run (backend → UI)

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M2-W1`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `frontend`, `streaming`, `wave:1`
- Depends on: `BL-005`, `BL-001d`, `BL-002`

## Problem

ReportPanel needs incremental preview updates (report_delta) while the run is executing. Repo currently streams assistant text via AI SDK, but not structured report preview events.

## Proposed solution

Implement report preview streaming:
- Backend graph emits `report_preview_started` and `report_preview_delta` run events while generating report draft.
- Adapter also forwards report deltas as AI SDK `data` chunks to the UI so ReportPanel can update without polling.
- UI subscribes to both: AI SDK data stream for content + SSE run stream for metadata and ordering.

## Acceptance criteria

- During a run, ReportPanel updates at least every N seconds (configurable) with new draft content.
- Final report preview is stored as an artifact or deliverable record for later retrieval.

## Test plan

- Integration: run triggers report deltas; UI test harness receives and applies updates.
