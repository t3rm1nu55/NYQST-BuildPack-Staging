# ENT-005 — Data retention, deletion, and export (GDPR baseline)

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M6-ENTERPRISE`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `backend`, `compliance`
- Depends on: `ENT-003`

## Problem

Production deployments require retention policies, right-to-delete, and export of tenant data, especially for regulated clients.

## Proposed solution

- Define retention policy configuration per tenant.
- Implement deletion workflows for: documents, artifacts, runs, conversations (with tombstones for audit).
- Implement export endpoints/jobs producing a tenant export bundle.

## Acceptance criteria

- Admin can request export; system produces a downloadable bundle.
- Delete requests remove data or anonymize appropriately while preserving audit logs.

## Test plan

- Integration: delete workflow removes rows and blobs; export contains expected data.
