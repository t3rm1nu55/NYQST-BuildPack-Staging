# BL-008 — PlanViewer UI: render PlanSet with live task status updates

- Type: **story**
- Milestone: `M2-W1`
- Repo alignment: **missing**
- Labels: `frontend`, `plan`, `wave:1`
- Depends on: `BL-007`, `BL-002b`

## Problem

UI currently lacks a plan inspector. Users need to see what the agent is doing, task-by-task, and how far along it is.

## Proposed solution

Implement `PlanViewer` component and integrate into ResearchPage layout:
- Render tasks grouped by status (queued/running/completed/failed)
- Show task details, evidence links, and timestamps
- Live update via run_event stream (plan_task_status_changed etc)
- On reload, rehydrate from `GET /runs/{run_id}/plan`

## Repo touchpoints

- `ui/src/components/plans/* (new)`
- `ui/src/pages/ResearchPage.tsx`

## Acceptance criteria

- PlanViewer shows tasks with live status updates during a run.
- Refreshing the page reloads plan state and continues streaming updates.

## Test plan

- UI test: render plan set and update a task state; verify DOM updates.
