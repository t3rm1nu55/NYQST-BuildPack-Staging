# Standalone mock (no build tools)

If you just want to *see the screens* without wiring into your repo:

1) Open `index.html` in a browser (requires internet for Tailwind CDN).
2) Click the left nav to swap screens.
3) Use the “Apps” screen to open an app detail panel.

This is a lightweight approximation of the React mock.
The authoritative mock is `NyqstPortalMockupV2.tsx`.
