# [GAP-036] EXTRACTION-SUMMARY Section (Comparison to DocuIntelli Platform Primitives) notes: "Multi-channel Output: Superagent offers Report, Website, Presentation — Superagent is wider." NYQST v1 scope includes Report (Phase 2), Website iframe (Phase 2), Slides (BL-018). However, Superagent's "Generated Document" type (`gml-viewgenerateddocument`) is not explicitly addressed in the backlog. It is unclear whether this maps to the NYQST document export (BL-019) or is a distinct output type.

## Details

- **ID**: GAP-036
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: EXTRACTION-SUMMARY Section (Comparison to DocuIntelli Platform Primitives) notes: "Multi-channel Output: Superagent offers Report, Website, Presentation — Superagent is wider." NYQST v1 scope includes Report (Phase 2), Website iframe (Phase 2), Slides (BL-018). However, Superagent's "Generated Document" type (`gml-viewgenerateddocument`) is not explicitly addressed in the backlog. It is unclear whether this maps to the NYQST document export (BL-019) or is a distinct output type.
- **Affected BL Items**: BL-018 (Slides), BL-019 (Document Export)
- **Source Evidence**: EXTRACTION-SUMMARY (GML View Types: gml-viewreport, gml-viewwebsite, gml-viewpresentation, gml-viewgenerateddocument); KNOWLEDGE-MAP Section 5
- **Resolution**: Clarify whether `gml-viewgenerateddocument` maps to BL-019 (Document Export — PDF/DOCX). If yes, ensure BL-019 acceptance criteria include the `gml-viewgenerateddocument` tag handling. If it is a distinct output type (e.g., "generated data document" as opposed to a "report"), determine whether it is in v1 scope or deferred.
- **Owner Recommendation**: Product lead
- **Wave**: W1 — before BL-018 and BL-019 implementation
